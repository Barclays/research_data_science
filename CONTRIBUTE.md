# Contributing

Initially, we welcome limited open-source contributions. Please contact us at ResearchDataScienceGithub@barclays.com to see if your contribution fits the current scope of our package, and to complete the contributor’s agreement. We especially encourage contribution of new data modules. The most broadly impactful might be those accessing open data sets, as they're free for anyone to use. Also very valuable are contributions from data vendors who would like to make it easier for customers in academia and industry to use their data sets.

Top-level guidelines for contributions are:
* All data modules should be for data sets which are _available to anyone_ for use or purchase;
* All data modules should follow our standard module structure and naming conventions;
* All contributions should avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies on other packages;
* Contributions should not expand the scope of the library beyond being a data access library means to expand pandas' core functionality for the purposes of constructing and manipulating financial cross-sectional time series and panel data.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, Barclays must have on file a signed Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") from each contributor, indicating agreement with our licence terms. This agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of Barclays and our projects’ users. Please complete and sign the [Agreement](legal/Barclays%20Contrib%20Agreement%20Github.docx), and then email a pdf copy to ResearchDataScienceGithub@barclays.com.
